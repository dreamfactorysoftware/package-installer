DreamFactory Platform Package Installer (PPI) is a tool for installing applications, libraries and plug-ins on to your [DSP](https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/dsp-core). 

Packages installed with this tool are safe from system upgrades.

## Packaging with Composer
By default, the PPI leverages the package manager used by the DSP, [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). While this document and the package installer require a `composer.json` file to install your package, DSP packages are not required, or limited, to utilize this packaging method. See [Packaging Without Composer][] for more information on alternative packaging.

### What's Composer?
Composer is a dependency manager tracking local dependencies of your projects and libraries.

See [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/) for more information and documentation.

### Installation and Usage
No installation is required. To have the PPI install your package, you need to set the `composer.json` property [type](http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#type) to one of the following types:

 * `dreamfactory-application`
 * `dreamfactory-library`
 * `dreamfactory-plugin`

#### Applications
Applications are DSP applications that consist of only client-side code. These are installed to your DSP's `/storage/applications` directory.

#### Plugins/Libraries
Plugins, or libraries are DSP extensions that consist of code or code and UI components. These are installed to your DSP's `/storage/plugins` directory.

### Specifying Your Package Details
In addition to specifying a package type, the PPI utilizes the "extra" section of your project's configuration file (`composer.json`). In this section you can customize the installation of your DSP package:

    {
        "extra": {
        	"data":	{
        		"application":	{
					"api-name":                "pbox",
					"name":                    "Portal Sandbox",
					"description":             "A sample application that demonstrates the DSP's portal service.",
					"url":                     "/index.php",
					"is-url-external":         false,
					"import-url":              "https://github.com/dreamfactorysoftware/portal-sandbox/archive/master.zip",
					"is-active":               true,
					"requires-fullscreen":     false,
					"allow-fullscreen-toggle": true,
					"toggle-location":         "top"
			}
			"config":       "config/app.config.php",
			"links":        [
				{
					"target": "src/",
					"link":   "pbox"
				}
			]
		}
        }
    }

In the above example we are giving our package a pretty name, an `api_name` (which defines the route) and a few other details.

#### Application Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `api-name`|string|The API name for the app|            
| `name`|string|The display name of the app|
| `description`|string|The description of the app|         
| `is-active`|boolean|If false, app is ignored by DSP|           
| `url`|string|The absolute/relative url to this app|                 
| `is-url-external`|boolean|Indicates the source of the url|     
| `import-url`|string|The url from which this app can be downloaded|          
| `storage-service-id`|int|The id of the storage service|  
| `storage-container`|string|The container on the storage service which stores this app|   
| `requires-fullscreen`|boolean|If true, full screen mode is default| 
| `allow-fullscreen-toggle`|boolean|If true, full screen mode toggle is available|
| `toggle-location`|string|The location of the toggle. Defaults to "top"|
